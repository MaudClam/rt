# GENERAL RULES
#
# Each type of element separated by one or more line break(s).
#
# Each type of information from an element separated by one or more background(s).
#
# Each element type except Resolution (1) can be set in any order in the file.
#
# Elements which are defined by a capital letter only declared once.
#
# Each element firstâ€™s information is the type identifier (composed by one or
# two character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a
# strict order.
#
# Two or more objects can be combined into one object using union, subtraction,
# or intersection operations. To do this, use the following between the objects
# on a separate line: UNION, SUBTRACTION or INTERSECTION. For example:
# sp  0.0,0.0,20.6  10.6  10,0,255
# UNION
# sp  0.0,0.0,20.6  12  10,0,255
# INTERSECTION
# sp  0.0,0.0,20.6  12.6  10,0,255
#
# (1)The first line of the file must contain the Resolution.
#
# (2)Will definitely be normalized during the parsing.
#
# (3)The value of a numeric element that is outside the allowed range will be
# brought to the limits of this range during parsing.
#
# (4)Color can also be in hexadecimal formats 0xRRGGBB and #BBGGRR, where each
# component is in the range [0,FF].
#
# (5)Optional. To activate an optional parameter, the previous optional
# parameters must be active or marked '0'.
#
# (6)Refractive index is inactive if the refractive is '0'.
